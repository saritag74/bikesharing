Dataframe

  i had fun working in this module had to build sheet, but before all of that could be done i had to change tripduration to datetype. so we had to use pandas for this delirable. 
Then from there we could start working ont tableau.
In here we are going to be showing the following information.

1.Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
2.Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
3.Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

  In  the tableau there are mulitple sheets that will show line graphs or heatmap.

The results of the fisrts sheet

  In the first section we can see how i had to create a data frame and also a csv file to be able to pull the informatioin from there.
in here we had to chage the datatype on the tripduration.

TABLEAU SHEET!

  in this section we had to create a line graph to demoste the show the line by the time (hours, minutes)
 ones this chart was provided wer had to  create another one but this one had to be similiar to the same line grapgh only thing that change was we included the genders(Females,Males). in order to do that we had to converete the gender information in order to be able to provided that female and male informatoin. . on the third one and fourth one its heatcharts. which is the same as 1 & 2 but this time is with startertime and stoptime .the other ome is starttimeand stoptime, but with a little twist on it which is including the gender. the laston was mostly just the gender chart
